- ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! As stated in my profile I'm a developer, localizer, techy, gamer, specifically a Y-YYUGE PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and Falcom/Ys fan known for various fan localization projects/apps/tools which is likely how you know me! I opened this Github because a lot of my source code needs to eventually go public/open-source in case something happens to me and because I've accepted the loss of motivation/interest to finish many of the projects I started, so time to share my work/experiments/tinkering. I am primarily interested in uploading my source code for TurboRip, a CD-ripping app for PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM games, so stay tuned for that when I eventually get around to it. I'll follow it up by sharing material for past Ys localization projects and general-purpose Win32 tools. Feel free to nudge me if I forget, keep on procrastinating.

2) "Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys" [PC Engine CD] - This was my dream project and hard to believe it became a reality! In terms of shear number of fellow localizers [team members], it's THE biggest project I ever led/worked on counting programmers, translators, testers, and even fan voice-actors! Hard to believe it all started by winning a TurboGrafx-16 and then buying a $99 Turbo Duo that included the legendary Ys Book I & II!
