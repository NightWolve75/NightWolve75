- ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! As stated in my profile I'm a developer, localizer, techy, gamer, specifically a Y-YYUGE PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and Falcom/Ys fan known for various fan localization projects/apps/tools which is likely how you know me! I opened this Github because a lot of my source code needs to eventually go public/open-source in case something happens to me and because I've accepted the loss of motivation/interest to finish many of the projects I started, so time to share my work/experiments/tinkering. I am primarily interested in uploading my source code for TurboRip, a CD-ripping app for PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM games, so stay tuned for that when I eventually get around to it. I'll follow it up by sharing material for past Ys localization projects and general-purpose Win32 tools. Feel free to nudge me if I forget, keep on procrastinating.


# Localization Portfolio.

1) "Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence" [PC Engine CD] 2001-2004

Localizers have to start somewhere! For me it was Xak III because it was the easiest candidate for the PC Engine CD platform: ANSI/8x16 font support was ready, the script wasn't compressed, and the text blocks were large enough such that by adjusting their 16-bit pointers you could fit full English translations! I wanted Ys IV or Legend of Xanadu but didn't have enough experience for compression cases, so that's how Xak III and I found ourselves a match! ; )<br/>

2) "Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys" (1993)[PC Engine CD] 2002-2004/2012

This was my dream project and hard to believe it became a reality! In terms of shear number of fellow localizers [team members], it's THE biggest project I ever led/worked on counting programmers, translators, testers, and even fan voice-actors! Hard to believe it all started by winning a TurboGrafx-16 and then buying a $99 Turbo Duo that included the legendary Ys Book I & II!

6) Hydlide (1999)[Windows 95/98/ME/2K/XP/V/7] 2004

I basically just cracked this game upon request by the translator, debugged it to disable the registration system and free it as the abandonware that it is so everyone can install/play it! I remember I rented the NES port and liked it, but I never gave this PC one a try. It was a favor for a fellow localizer.<br/>
