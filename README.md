- 👋 Howdy! As stated in my profile I'm a developer, localizer, techy, gamer, specifically a Y-YYUGE PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 and Falcom/Ys fan known for various fan localization projects/apps/tools which is likely how you know me! I opened this Github because a lot of my source code needs to eventually go public/open-source in case something happens to me and because I've accepted the loss of motivation/interest to finish many of the projects I started, so time to share my work/experiments/tinkering. I am primarily interested in uploading my source code for TurboRip, a CD-ripping app for PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM games, so stay tuned for that when I eventually get around to it. I'll follow it up by sharing material for past Ys localization projects and general-purpose Win32 tools. Feel free to nudge me if I forget, keep on procrastinating.

1) Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence (1994)[PC Engine CD] 2001-2004

Localizers have to start somewhere! For me it was Xak III because it was the easiest candidate for the PC Engine CD platform: ANSI/8x16 font support was ready, the script wasn't compressed, and the text blocks were large enough such that by adjusting their 16-bit pointers you could fit full English translations! I wanted Falcom's Ys IV or Legend of Xanadu but didn't have enough experience for compression cases, so that's how Xak III and I found ourselves a match! ; )

2) Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys (1993)[PC Engine CD] 2002-2004/2012

This was my dream project and hard to believe it became a reality! In terms of shear number of fellow localizers [team members], it's THE biggest project I ever led/worked on counting programmers, translators, testers, and even fan voice-actors! Hard to believe it all started by winning a TurboGrafx-16 and then buying a $99 Turbo Duo that included the legendary Ys Book I & II!

6) Hydlide (1999)[Windows 95/98/ME/2K/XP/V/7] 2004

I basically just cracked this game upon request by the translator, debugged it to disable the registration system and free it as the abandonware that it is so everyone can install/play it! I remember I rented the NES port as a kid and liked it, but I never gave this PC one a try. It was merely a favor for a fellow localizer/collaborator.<br/>

7) Dead of the Brain (1993)[PC Engine CD] 2023 <img src="https://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji316.png" />

No, NOT a trick, a Halloween treat! Presenting the
<a href="https://romhacking.net/translations/7087/">Dead of the Brain 1 English patch</a> by David
Shadoff for the DEAD last official PC Engine CD game published by NEC before exiting the console biz
in 1999! I helped edit/betatest after Dave told me it was nearly ready, so I applied my global spell check method after packing the script strings in one file and it also counts as a game I actually finished in 2023, yaaaay!
<a href="https://twitter.com/shubibiman/status/1719240138469810596">Shubibiman</a> also did
<a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/7089/">a French localization</a> for its fans.

8) Erst Kerf (2008)[Windows 2K/XP/V/7/10/11] 2025

Similar to Hydlide the localizers here asked me for help on a final issue after the project was mostly finished to extend some strings. I found memory allocation bugs in the process which I also fixed and added a few minor tweaks like window-centering. Great experience to work with both of them, and they helped me with my Langrisser III localization project in kind on wave/audio recovery!
